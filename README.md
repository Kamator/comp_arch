# comp_arch
This git repo contains a minimal RISC-V implementation. It implements the majority (but not all) instructions of the RV321 Base Integer Instruction Set without any
extensions.
Note that RISC-V is a load-store architecture, where memory is addressed as 8-bit bytes using little-endian ordering.
